                      What can I tell you about student exchange that can do justice to this surreal experience!
                      Living in a completely strange land for an entire year with people you don’t know before even hitting puberty, traveling the world with other curious individuals like you, learning a whole new language, celebrating the culture and food of a foreign land, for an entire year!
                      That’s what a student exchange is. <br><br>
                                            Let me paint a picture of what mine was like!
                      I had been the Charter President of Interact Club, Rotary in school and found out about the program through the annual brochure. ‘Youth Ambassador of India’- you had to basically represent your country in a foreign land. Fascinated, I signed up immediately and started prepping for the exams and interviews. I still remember my final interview was a day before my 10th board exams. 8 years later, the interview still plays in my head like it happened yesterday. A panel of four Rotarians representing Rotary International tested me on my general knowledge and asked me my ‘why’s’.
                      You get to give a list of top 3 countries you’d want to visit but the club decides where you’ll go. I was ecstatic to find out I could go to Germany- my first preference! You pay for the flight ticket and your insurance, that’s all! You even get weekly allowance.

                </div>
                <div class="text-holder">
                  <p class="paragraph-v2"  style="font-family:'Amiri'; font-size:20px">
                      I was 15 years old. Stay. The only one thing I was nervous about was catching my flight. I had never travelled internationally ever and the idea of boarding a plane, specially catching a connecting flight was the part that made me nervous. <br><br>
                      Your host families (families you stay with) are chosen by the Rotary club you are a part of in your host country and every student typically stays with 3 families for four months each.
                      I had three host families and their children were on exchange in other countries. Oh yes, we had a French girl back home in India who stayed with us for four months! So, two of my host father’s were brothers! It was like living in one big family!
                      There were three other exchange students in my Rotary Club from Peru, USA and Brazil, we alternated through three families.<br><br>
                       So what do you do all year- I went to a German school and attended class like any student, on weekends I had Rotary club events, throughout the year I delivered presentation about India’s culture and lifestyle in schools colleges and social clubs. This was routine. After school, I engaged in the local city life and spent time with my family. Within 3 months, I started understanding German and about 7-8 months, I was fluent in the language! Apparently a different language brings out a different personality in you and I can tell you its true! It is like I could appreciate the country on an altogether different level!
                      Like me, there were 60 other exchange students from 14 different countries in my state. We took a Euro Tour together and that was the best time of my life!

                      I was nobody but a curious soul wandering with other like minded people from all over the world, exploring and finding myself.
                      EVERY SINGLE DAY WAS OVERWHELMING. Everyday you know you have one day less on your exchange and it fills you with this uncontrollable zest to live the day to the fullest, learn, move, ask questions. If we had the same desire for our lives, it is short anyway right? <br><br>
                      This experience has shaped in ways that reflects in all my endeavours. Before I left, my grand mother asked me ‘What is the need to do this? Don’t you had a life that is sufficient for you here. You do well in your academics here, you have a balanced life. Then why?’ I remember the 15 year old me said ‘Why not?’ The simple why not led me to finding a home in someone in every corner of the world, memories that make me smile and cry at the same time, and an outlook of the world I would have never imagined having otherwise.<br>
                      Even today, when I speak to my friends and family from exchange, my heart smiles with gratitude. <br><br>
                      This jacket is the pride of an exchange student. It’s the whole world, every experience-right here. It is heavy but the most beautiful thing I have of my own. Just like my exchange. Heavy and overwhelming but mine to treasure.<br>
                      I feel very strongly about capitalising on this opportunity and that is why I wanted this blog to be a space for encouraging it.
                      Here is the link that will help you get more information about the program. Contact your nearest Rotary Club to apply.<br><br>
